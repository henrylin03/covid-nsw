# covid-nsw
In this project, I analyse reported COVID-19 case numbers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

## Description
In the `covid-nsw.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, I provide analysis of reported COVID cases in NSW.

In the Python environment, I used:
* `pandas`
* SQL (`sqlite3`)
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

to import, clean, query, transform, and visualise interesting insights in the dataset.

## Data Source
[NSW COVID-19 cases by location](https://data.nsw.gov.au/search/dataset/ds-nsw-ckan-aefcde60-3b0c-4bc0-9af1-6fe652944ec2/details?q=) is published by NSW Health.
