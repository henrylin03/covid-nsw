# COVID-19 Data Analysis in NSW

In this project, I explore and visualise the impact of the pandemic in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Through this project, I showcase my skills in data analysis, including SQL (SQLite3), Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and other libraries used to extract and communicate insights.

## Project Overview

In this project, I obtained reported COVID-19 cases from the [NSW Health website](https://data.nsw.gov.au/search/dataset/ds-nsw-ckan-aefcde60-3b0c-4bc0-9af1-6fe652944ec2/details?q=), and performed the following tasks:

- **Data Pipeline Building**: I built a data pipeline that automates the entire process of fetching, cleaning, and analysing the data, using Python and SQLite3.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: I cleaned and transformed the raw data to remove duplicates, missing values, and other inconsistencies that could affect the analysis.
- **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Using Pandas, I explored the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between different variables such as the number of cases over time and by location and variants/waves, as well as days without any reported cases ("zero days").
- **Data Visualisation**: I created several visualisations using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including choropleth maps, line charts, donut charts, and bar charts to communicate the key findings and insights from the data in a clear and concise way.

## Technologies Used

- SQL (SQLite3): for data cleaning, preparation, and manipulation
- Pandas: for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: for data visualisation and exploration
- Wikipedia: for downloading tables from Wikipedia pages

## How to Use the Project

To replicate my analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/covid-nsw.git
   ```

2. Open and run the `analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to see the results of the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Conclusion

Through this project, I sharpened my skills in data pipeline building, data cleaning, analysis and visualisation using a variety of tools and libraries.
